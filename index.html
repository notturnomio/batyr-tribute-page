              <p>Batyrkhan Shukenov (May 1962 — April 2015) was a Soviet Kazakhstan and Russian singer, musician, saxophonist, composer, poet.</p>
              <p>Batyrkhan started his career in 1982 as a saxophonist in the ensemble of the honored artist of the Kazakh SSR, Roza Rymbayeva. In 1987, he became the soloist of the Alma-Ata band (Alma-Ata Studio). In two years the name was replaced by A'Studio. Their original style was a mixture of jazz, funk and the romance of Kazakh folk songs. Their music was distinguished by complex outstripping arrangements and a delicate musical taste. In total, A'Studio with Batyrkhan Shukenov released eight albums, the last one in 1998.</p>
              <p>In 2000, Batyrkhan Shukenov leaved the A'Studio and engaged in solo activities. In 2002 he released his first album — "The Motherland". It was a revelation of the new Kazakh composer's school — no one before managed to convey nomadic motifs under the chic of luxurious jazz and notes of bossa nova. He recorded five solo albums in total, the last one "A Soul" in 2013.</p>
              <p>In 2007, he was appointed as the Cultural Advisor to the President of Kazakhstan. Since November 20, 2009 he has been the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in Kazakhstan. Became the Honored Activist of Arts of Kazakhstan in 2010.</p>
              <p>Batyrkhan Shukenov died at age 52 in Moscow from a heart attack. He was buried in his musical hometown — Almaty, Kazakhstan. On 29 April 2015 in Moscow the ceremony of farewell to Shukenov was attended by hundreds of celebrities and friends. In Almaty at that time, thousands of fans gathered at the Palace of the Republic Square singing favorite songs in honor of their idol.</p>
